<h1>Kev Bayliss</h1>
<p><strong>Artist & Game Creator</strong></p>

<p>
I’m an artist and game creator with a long history of designing and bringing
characters, worlds, and ideas to life for video games and beyond.
Alongside my work in games, I create original traditional artwork,
including paintings and one-off commissions.
</p>

<p>
My focus is on character, personality, and storytelling — whether that’s through
digital creation or paint on canvas.
</p>

<p>
Selected original artworks are available to buy online.
</p>
