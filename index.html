  <h1>Kev Bayliss</h1>
  <p><strong>Artist & Game Creator</strong></p>

  <p>
    I’m an artist and game creator with a long history of designing and bringing
    characters, worlds, and ideas to life for video games and beyond.
    <p>
I’m perhaps best known for my work on DONKEY KONG COUNTRY  and other classic video games,
where I helped create and define characters that went on to become part of gaming history.
My work spans character design, animation, and visual development across both games and traditional art.
</p>

    Alongside my work in games, I create original traditional artwork,
    including paintings and one-off commissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    My focus is on character, personality, and storytelling — whether that’s through
    digital creation or paint on canvas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Selected original artworks are available to buy online.
